# This project is frontend-only and does NOT require any environment variables.
#
# If you later add build-time configuration (Vite exposes only variables prefixed with VITE_),
# you can document them here and set them in DigitalOcean App Platform "Environment Variables".
#
# Example:
# VITE_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://api.example.com
